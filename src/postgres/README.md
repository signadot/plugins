# PostgreSQL Plugin

This directory contains the source for the postgres resource plugin.

If you only want to install the plugin, rather than change it, see the
[Helm chart](../../signadot-plugins-exp/postgres/).

The file sandbox.yaml provides an example usage from the perspective of
the consumption of the allocated resources.
